used multiple functions for different task.
retrieve file names from .txt
read through each file, and append contents to global value.

overall, based on project 3, and modified it on that

used participant object to store all the participants individual information
update and retrieve via method, get / set

store all objects in a list

when encounter the same person, update the value by call addDistance() method

also, max and min are stored globally

and if > or <, it will update the max or min.


****I do not know why the TA said I have logic error.
Firstly, those functions are designed in a good way that they can not only be applied here
but can be used mostly genericly with other same data/objects/data structure 
They are not hard coded, and each function is not lengthy

They are not redundant. You do not want to make a function 100 lines of code
or put different functionalities into one function, that is not right.

My functions do the exactly simple work as its name describes. simplified the code, easier for debug and reuse.


For example:
I separated fileretrieve and processFile to 2 functions:
1.what if there is no such a master file containing filenames, you can just call processFile with one filename.
2.This is the right thing to do.

Honestly, I have never heard something like logic error often and because of that I lose points. Every program is designed by different people
follows a certain way,If the functions can represent their functionality, code is simple and easy to understand, reuse and efficient, 
it should be in a good shape. 
If logic is really wrong, or there is a logic error, the program should not produce the correct result or there will be errors or exceptions,
but none of these situations happens on my code

Thank you.
