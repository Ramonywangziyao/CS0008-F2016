used three functions:

ProcessFile()
printKV()
nameRequest()

nameRequest is a callback to processfile which returns the name of the file user typed as the parameter to processfile in order
to open the file
Also File not exist is detected


printkv simply use format() to format different values. If ifelse considered as the functionality of switch

There is no specific value in the code but only variables.
All the length of different variables (key, value, decimal places) can be modified through those variables at the top of the program
so the program is not hardcoded except the arraylength(Because the purpose of this program is only for such file contents X:X)
Also to prevent the accidental modification of array length of any array objects, there is detection for the dismatch so it won't crush
the program
